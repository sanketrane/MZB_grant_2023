@article{Hao:2021,
	abstract = {Summary
The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities represents an exciting frontier for single-cell genomics and necessitates computational methods that can define cellular states based on multimodal data. Here, we introduce ``weighted-nearest neighbor'' analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.},

@article{Dormann:2018,
	abstract = {In ecology, the true causal structure for a given problem is often not known, and several plausible models and thus model predictions exist. It has been claimed that using weighted averages of these models can reduce prediction error, as well as better reflect model selection uncertainty. These claims, however, are often demonstrated by isolated examples. Analysts must better understand under which conditions model averaging can improve predictions and their uncertainty estimates. Moreover, a large range of different model averaging methods exists, raising the question of how they differ in their behaviour and performance. Here, we review the mathematical foundations of model averaging along with the diversity of approaches available. We explain that the error in model-averaged predictions depends on each model's predictive bias and variance, as well as the covariance in predictions between models, and uncertainty about model weights. We show that model averaging is particularly useful if the predictive error of contributing model predictions is dominated by variance, and if the covariance between models is low. For noisy data, which predominate in ecology, these conditions will often be met. Many different methods to derive averaging weights exist, from Bayesian over information-theoretical to cross-validation optimized and resampling approaches. A general recommendation is difficult, because the performance of methods is often context dependent. Importantly, estimating weights creates some additional uncertainty. As a result, estimated model weights may not always outperform arbitrary fixed weights, such as equal weights for all models. When averaging a set of models with many inadequate models, however, estimating model weights will typically be superior to equal weights. We also investigate the quality of the confidence intervals calculated for model-averaged predictions, showing that they differ greatly in behaviour and seldom manage to achieve nominal coverage. Our overall recommendations stress the importance of non-parametric methods such as cross-validation for a reliable uncertainty quantification of model-averaged predictions.},

@article{Wintle:2003,
	abstract = {In conservation biology, uncertainty about the choice of a statistical model is rarely considered. Model-selection uncertainty occurs whenever one model is chosen over plausible alternative models to represent understanding about a process and to make predictions about future observations. The standard approach to representing prediction uncertainty involves the calculation of prediction (or confidence) intervals that incorporate uncertainty about parameter estimates contingent on the choice of a "best" model chosen to represent truth. However, this approach to prediction based on statistical models tends to ignore model-selection uncertainty, resulting in overconfident predictions. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has been promoted in a range of disciplines as a simple means of incorporating model-selection uncertainty into statistical inference and prediction. Bayesian model averaging also provides a formal framework for incorporating prior knowledge about the process being modeled. We provide an example of the application of BMA in modeling and predicting the spatial distribution of an arboreal marsupial in the Eden region of southeastern Australia. Other approaches to estimating prediction uncertainty are discussed.},

	abstract = {T cells expand without intentional antigen stimulation when transferred into adult lymphopenic environments. In this study, we show that the physiologic lymphopenic environment existing in neonatal mice also supports CD4 T cell proliferation. Strikingly, naive CD4 T cells that proliferate within neonates acquire the phenotypic and functional characteristics of memory cells. Such proliferation is inhibited by the presence of both memory and naive CD4 T cells, is enhanced by 3-day thymectomy, is independent of IL-7, and requires a class II MHC-TCR interaction and a CD28-mediated signal. CD44bright CD4 T cells in neonates have a wide repertoire as judged by the distribution of Vβ expression. Thus, lymphopenia-induced T cell proliferation is a physiologic process that occurs during the early postnatal period.},

@article{Guerrier_2012,
	abstract = {Be they follicular cells within the germinal centers (GCs) or marginal zone (MZ), all na{\"\i}ve mature B lymphocytes need tonic signaling to stay alive. We reasoned that the same holds true for those B lymphocytes that proliferate in the salivary glands (SGs) of patients with primary Sj{\"o}gren's syndrome. Based on B cell infiltration, 11 SGs and three tonsil samples were selected for further examination. Tissue sections were stained using CD20 combined with CD10, CD21, CD27, CD38 or IgD. They were also laser-microdissected for quantitative RT-PCR of transcription factors, GC-specific activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and TLR9. Some B cell aggregates proved to be real GCs according to their membrane markers, whereas others were clusters of transitional type II B cells. These contained mRNAs for Notch-2 and Blimp-1, but not for Pax-5, Bcl-6 and AID. Unanticipated was the finding of mRNAs for TLR9 in these clusters of MZ B-cells, but not in the real GCs. Not only do TLR9 deliver sufficiency of tonic signaling to keep B cells alive, but they also confer autoreactive B cells with an MZ-like phenotype. Thus, TLRs might be targets for forthcoming biotherapies.},

@article{Palm_2021,
	abstract = {Marginal zone (MZ) B cells comprise a subset of innate-like B cells found predominantly in the spleen, but also in lymph nodes and blood. Their principal functions are participation in quick responses to blood-borne pathogens and secretion of natural antibodies. The latter is important for housekeeping functions such as clearance of apoptotic cell debris. MZ B cells have B cell receptors with low poly-/self-reactivity, but they are not pathogenic at steady state. However, if simultaneously stimulated with self-antigen and pathogen- and/or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs), MZ B cells may participate in the initial steps towards breakage of immunological tolerance. This review summarizes what is known about the role of MZ B cells in autoimmunity, both in mouse models and human disease. We cover factors important for shaping the MZ B cell compartment, how the functional properties of MZ B cells may contribute to breaking tolerance, and how MZ B cells are being regulated.},

We and others have recently reported that natural killer cells and/or natural killer cell derived lymphokines may provide a form of `help' that is necessary for the induction and maintenance of Tl-2 responses. Two natural killer cell derived lymphokines, interferon-γ and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, show synergistic stimulatory activity in inducing lg secretion in B cells stimulated by a multivalent ligand that mimics Tl-2 antigens. The recent finding that natural killer cells have receptors for various classes of polysaccharides supports a role for these cells in regulating responses to Tl-2 antigens.},

	abstract = {Summary
High-affinity antibodies are generated in germinal centers in a process involving mutation and selection of B cells. Information processing in germinal center reactions has been investigated in a number of recent experiments. These have revealed cell migration patterns, asymmetric cell divisions, and cell-cell interaction characteristics, used here to develop a theory of germinal center B cell selection, division, and exit (the LEDA model). According to this model, B cells selected by T follicular helper cells on the basis of successful antigen processing always return to the dark zone for asymmetric division, and acquired antigen is inherited by one daughter cell only. Antigen-retaining B cells differentiate to plasma cells and leave the germinal center through the dark zone. This theory has implications for the functioning of germinal centers because compared to previous models, high-affinity antibodies appear one day earlier and the amount of derived plasma cells is considerably larger.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Aging is associated with a decline in B-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow and accumulation of long-lived B cells in the periphery. These changes decrease the body's ability to mount protective antibody responses. We show here that age-related changes in the B lineage are mediated by the accumulating long-lived B cells. Thus, depletion of B cells in old mice was followed by expansion of multipotent primitive progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors, a revival of B-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow, and generation of a rejuvenated peripheral compartment that enhanced the animal's immune responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. Collectively, our results suggest that immunosenescence in the B-lineage is not irreversible and that depletion of the long-lived B cells in old mice rejuvenates the B-lineage and enhances immune competence.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Splenic marginal-zone B cells, marginal-zone B cells of Peyer's patches in the gut, and nodal marginal-zone B cells (also identified as monocytoid B cells) share a similar morphology and immunophenotype. These cells likely represent a distinct subset of B cells in humans and rodents, but their precise ontogenetic relationship as well as their origin from B cells of the germinal center is still debated. To study this, we performed a mutation analysis of the rearranged immunoglobulin variable genes (VH) of microdissected single nodal and splenic marginal-zone cells. In addition, we investigated the presence of proliferating cells and B-cell clones in the human splenic and nodal marginal zone as well as adjacent germinal centers. This was performed by immunohistochemical staining for the Ki-67 antigen and denaturing gradient gel analysis of amplified immunoglobulin heavy chain genes' complementarity determining region 3 of microdissected cell clusters. A variable subset of nodal and splenic marginal-zone B cells showed somatic mutations in their rearranged VH genes, indicating that both virgin and memory B cells are present in the nodal and splenic marginal zone. Nodal and splenic marginal-zone B cells preferentially rearranged VH3 family genes such as DP47, DP49, DP54, and DP58. A preferential rearrangement of the same VH genes has been shown by others in the peripheral CD5− IgM+ B cells. These data suggest that the splenic and nodal marginal-zone B cells are closely related B-cell subsets. We also showed that marginal-zone B cells may cycle and that clones of B cells are frequently detected in the nodal as well as the splenic marginal zone. These clones are not related to those present in adjacent germinal centers. These data favor the hypothesis that clonal expansion occurs in the marginal zone. Whether the somatic hypermutation mechanism is activated during the clonal expansion in the marginal zone and which type of immune response triggers the clonal expansion need to be elucidated.},

	abstract = {Summary
Follicular mature (FM) and germinal center (GC) B cells underpin humoral immunity, but the dynamics of their generation and maintenance are not clearly defined. Here, we exploited a fate-mapping system in mice that tracks B cells as they develop into peripheral subsets, together with a cell division fate reporter mouse and mathematical models. We find that FM cells are kinetically homogeneous, recirculate freely, are continually replenished from transitional populations, and self-renew rarely. In contrast, GC B cell lineages persist for weeks with rapid turnover and site-specific dynamics. Those in the spleen derive from transitional cells and are kinetically homogeneous, while those in lymph nodes derive from FM B cells and comprise both transient and persistent clones. These differences likely derive from the nature of antigen exposure at the different sites. Our integrative approach also reveals how the host environment drives cell-extrinsic, age-related changes in B cell homeostasis.},

@article{DeBoer_2001,
	abstract = {Previous experiments with mouse chimeras demonstrated that cellular competition for antigen-specific survival signals plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the naive B cell repertoire. Transgenic (Tg) B cell populations in these chimeras have a shortened lifespan and poor competitive abilities as compared to more diverse non-Tg populations in the same mice. We develop a mathematical model to investigate the mechanism of B cell competition. The model allows for various B cell clones, generated in the bone marrow, to go into the peripheral circulation, where they compete specifically for various ligands providing survival signals. In the model we also find the observed poor competitive abilities of the Tg repertoire. Investigating the nature of the competition in the model, we find that most of the competition is intraspecific occurring largely within the clone of truly Tg B cells, and within the repertoire of leaky Tg and non-Tg B cells. This is confirmed by analysing a simplified version of the model, which only allows for intraspecific competition, and resembles a simple ecological model with density-dependent death. The fact that our model accounts for the data, casts doubt on a previous interpretation of the same data arguing that more diverse repertoires outcompete repertoires of lower diversity. Here, we conclude that most of the data can be explained with intraspecific competition, and formulate an experimental prediction that allows one to distinguish between the previous interpretation of inter-specific competition between repertoires, and the current interpretation of intraspecific competition.},

Altering the composition of the B cell receptor through N region additions decreases the rate of clonal production and the MZ enrichment. This process can be recapitulated by purified CD21low B cells and is due to a preferential clonal survival that requires a functional btk tyrosine kinase. We also show that generation of the MZ population is dependent on CD19. These findings suggest that the MZ B cell repertoire is positively selected and have functional implications for antigenic responses effected by B cells from this microenvironment.},

@article{Martin_Kearney_2000,
	abstract = {The rate of elimination of a pathogenic agent is of critical importance for the host and determines the extent and consequences of the infection. Antibody production, along with the activity of other cells of the immune system, plays an important role early and late in the response and contributes to all containment and elimination of the organism. B-cell clones reaching the mature long-lived pool are heterogeneous: some belong to the B1 B-cell subset, some are enriched in the CD21high compartment (mostly marginal zone (MZ)), whereas others recirculate primarily among the B-cell follicles (FO). This segregation is a T-independent, CD40L-independent but BCR/CD19-dependent process. Antigen encounter will recruit antigen-specific cells from the pool of mature B-lymphocytes and activate them to perform effector functions. CD21highCD23low B cells enriched in the MZ of the spleen initiate the early plasmablast wave during the first 3 days of an antibody response against particulate T-independent bacterial antigens. These findings indicate a functional heterogeneity within the mature B-lymphocyte population. MZ B cells and B1 B, in contrast to FO B cells, have the unique capacity to generate effector cells in early stages of the immune response against (particulate) antigens that are scavenged efficiently in these specialized anatomical sites.},

Some understanding has been obtained regarding the synergy between BCR-derived signals and other receptors and signaling pathways that drive the development of follicular, marginal zone, and B-1 B cells, but this remains a complex and poorly understood issue. More recent information regarding the origins of B-1 and B-2 B cells, the ability of follicular B cells to mature both in the bone marrow and the spleen, the existence of a definable precursor for MZ B cells, and the ability of follicular B cells to occupy two distinct niches are all highlighted in this review.},

@article{Schmidt_1993,
	abstract = {Splenic microcorrosion casts prepared using minimal volumes of material show that most of the flow passes through the region bordering the white pulp. However, the nature of these microcirculatory pathways has received little attention. We have studied these in dog, cat, rat, mouse, and normal versus diseased human spleens. In all 5 species, a marginal sinus (MS) of anastomosing vascular spaces 5-10 microns thick lies between the white pulp and marginal zone (MZ). The morphology differs between species and the MS is absent in immune thrombocytopenia. The MS fills by circumferential flow before blood passes outward to the MZ. Many capillaries supply the MS and MZ, their arrangement and degree of branching differing among species. Capillaries never terminate within the reticulum of the white pulp. In immune thrombocytopenia, marked vascular hyperplasia occurs within white pulp and MZ. The perimarginal cavernous sinus plexus (PMCS), found in human, dog and rat, comprises large flattened spaces up to 300 microns x 1000 microns in area and 30-100 microns thick. It lies between the MZ and red pulp or directly adjacent to white pulp, and receives flow principally via the MZ. In sinusal spleens, the MS, MZ and PMCS are drained by open-ended venous sinuses. In non-sinusal spleens, the MS and MZ are drained by pulp venules. Approximately 90% of the splenic inflow passes through the region bordering the white pulp, bypassing the filtration beds of the red pulp. This suggests that immunologic functions of the spleen take precedence over the filtration of blood cellular elements in the red pulp.},
